Combining crew interview, state-of-the-art surveys, and STPA-inspired analysis, the report traces research needsfor long-term autonomous vessels. You can get the report online here\nExecutive Summary Making a marine platform autonomous for long-duration missions of weeks to months at sea has been shown to be a fundamentally different challenge than those faced by crewless air and ground vehicles. Self-health assessment, mission planning and logistics consideration are all heightened for the marine vessel that may be out for weeks to months at a time. How- ever, how such assessments and mission planning is done on crewed vessels today is not well understood, which makes researching algorithms for this area difficult.\nThis work reports on a broad framework of risk concerns for such long-term missions, and then reviews current marine systems in service. Existing platforms show a clear tradeoff between platform complexity and achievable endurance. Gliders and simple platforms have completed weeks-to-month voyages but with high loss rates. More complex vessels are still in the days-to-low-weeks range of mission lengths, and no vessel currently performs long-term planning autonomously. A new three-component rating system was proposed to track plat- forms, using the platform’s decision-making, endurance, and platform complexity as metrics. Existing platforms were visualized with this system, confirming the capability gap.\nA series of interviews with ship and shore crews was used to attempt to determine how such planning is done today. This process revealed that machinery systems comprise the central concern around platform health. The maintenance of machinery is highly structured within the vessel’s preventative maintenance system (PMS). However, both integrating the overall health of the platform, and weighing risks for planning were done in a human-center manner. Such planning was not standardized or recorded in a formal procedure, but used extensive human experience and implicit criteria. Shore-side support was also widely used in diag- nosing problem, planning repairs, and supporting on-board decisions. Thus, the interviews produced a list of concerns but not a definite planning approach that could be automated.\nA high-level simulation-based approach was used to see how accurate planning around plat- form health had to be to improve operational performance. A fleet of 10 vessels was used to maintain a patrol line at different distances from a support base, with each vessel having a single health parameter that degraded stochastically. Four different planning approaches were compared, and the result showed that even imperfect long-term planning systems may produce large gains in platform effectiveness vs. static rule-based approaches.\nFinally, a modified STPA approach was used to try to explore significant risk areas for long-term planning systems. Two STPA formulations were compared, and the approach more narrowly focused on mission planning was able to identify broad areas where existing algorithms may be insufficient. A table of resulting challenge areas was constructed, and three development case studies were proposed to address the gaps in the table. These cases were designed to be tractable for basic research exploration yet involving enough disciplines to be broadly representative of the at-sea mission planning problem. The three case studies included a fuel management study, a machinery design and support case, and an adaptable risk level case. Suggestions for implementing these case studies, and further work, finalize the report.\n","date":1690761600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1690761600,"objectID":"dc99e5129fd16439e93c274b7f4a64f0","permalink":"https://mdcollette.github.io/post/23-07-31-senator/","publishdate":"2023-07-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/23-07-31-senator/","section":"post","summary":"The working report on long-term autonomy needs published last summer has surpassed 250 downloads.

By combining the concept of regret from robust optimization with that of design space reduction from set-based design, a new complementary view on uncertainty referred to as Design Space Covering for Uncertainty (DSC-U) is introduced. This method develops a trade-space between reducing the design space and locking in sub-optimal performance while considering interval uncertainty that impacts the problem. A double-loop algorithm and a more efficient set covering algorithm are presented along with the structure of the method. These are demonstrated on three sample problems, a previously-studied cantilever tube optimization, the Rosenbrock function with different levels of coupling between the uncertain parameters, and a ship midship section design problem with thirty-six design variables and four uncertain terms. The DSC-U approach is shown to be practical in providing a complementary insight into the impact of uncertainty for a wide range of design techniques.","tags":["regret","robust optimization","set covering","set-based design","Uncertainty"],"title":"Design Space Covering for Uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaihua Zhang","Matthew D.

However, few studies have attempted to validate such twins with experimental data. In this work, two system-level digital twin models for structural capacity degradation are evaluated with experimental data from a four-crack structural fatigue specimen. Each twin model is based on a dynamic Bayesian network, but the two models differ in the complexity of the crack-to-crack interaction model. Using measured crack lengths from the experiment, the ability of each twin to predict the evolution of future crack size is assessed. For this specimen, a high level of crack-to-crack interaction must be captured for the twin to realistically trace the evolution of the system. The suitability of Bayesian network based twins for this type of problem is discussed.","tags":["Dynamic Bayesian Network","Fatigue","Model evaluation","Structural Deterioration","System reliability"],"title":"Predicting growth and interaction of multiple cracks in structural systems using Dynamic Bayesian Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://mdcollette.github.io/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://mdcollette.github.io/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Joey Van Houten","David J.

It may be considered arbitrary in the grand scheme of marine design, but it can have far-reaching impacts on required rework in the maturation of an acceptable design solution. Marine design is largely human-driven in the handling of interdependent vessel characteristics between analyses, so any simulation capturing the progression and iteration of design activities must account for actual human tendencies. The following research extends a previous study exploring the likelihood of design convergence based on path selection [1]. The new study assumes analyses cannot be executed in multiple directions nor combined, which introduces different types of rework. The updated model explores the same variables and paths as the previous study through two simulations differing in experience and rework while simultaneously acknowledging the independent variables a designer has influence over with each design activity. Both simulations highlight the path benefits and flaws pertaining to convergence probability, designer influence, and requisite rework. With these new understandings, designers can begin to make more well-informed decisions on how to efficiently approach their own design problem.","tags":[],"title":"Balancing designer influence with rework for design paths of a simple polynomial model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brendan Sulkowski","Adam G.

How these long-term tasks are currently organized, exe- cuted, and regulated on human-crewed vessels is unexplored compared to more immediate navigation and hazard avoidance. This paper presents a series of inter-related explorations of the issues of longer- term mission planning in a fully autonomous framework. Based on the current state-of-the-art, a new three-component ranking scale for crewless platforms is proposed. Semi-structured interviews with retired military crews and commercial mariners were used to identify what planning tasks crews were currently carrying out. At the end of the interview process, themes from all interviews were reviewed, and an affinity diagram was created from the themes. The interviews revealed a surprising diversity in approaches, especially for tasks beyond machinery health assessment. Complementing this bottom-up analysis, a top-down analysis via a modified STAMP/STPA framework identifies critical information paths and control structures surrounding these tasks. By integrating the results of these two comple- mentary analyses, gaps in our current ability to achieve long-term autonomous operations are identified. Three proposed demonstration cases are developed to help develop approaches to fill these gaps.","tags":[],"title":"Long-Term Voyage Decision Making for Crewless Platforms","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"At the 15th International Symposium on Practical Design of Ships and Other Floating Structures (PRADS 2022) the MSDL was selected by the standing committee to host the 16th edition of the conference in Ann Arbor in 2025.

At these mission lengths, the platform must take on self-assessment and mission planning tasks as well as short-term autonomy tasks such as navigation. The results of a four-prong research program to explore these challenges are reported here. Existing vessels were reviewed and analyzed and a new rating system was constructed. Interviews with human crew members were carried out to identify assessment and planning approaches. A simplified simulation and an STPA-inspired analysis were used to identify areas where research would be beneficial. From these investigations, it is clear that existing planning systems rely heavily on humans to integrate different sources of information. Humans make decisions today based on shared experience and implicit criteria. Automating this process is a significant challenge. Three test cases are proposed to explore the identified research needs, one on fuel management, one on design and operational support of machinery systems, and one on adapting and updating risk criteria in service.","tags":[],"title":"Needs Exploration for Long-Term Autonomous Marine Systems: Working Report","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joey Van Houten","Matthew D.

L. Hunley conducted the first successful submarine attack on an enemy vessel, USS Housatonic, during the American Civil War but was lost with all hands because of unknown circumstances. The submarine has been recovered, and recent archeological findings have uncovered that a spar torpedo was used as opposed to a standoff torpedo that was commonly assumed to have been used. As a result, the submarine would have been in close proximity to the weapon when it exploded than previously thought. A multipart investigation has been conducted with the goal of determining if this reduced standoff distance could explain the mysterious loss of the vessel in the minutes or hours after the attack. Here, the results of a bottom-up naval architectural and weapons-effects analysis are reported. Together, the experimental, computational, and analytical results provide new insight to the vessel’s stability characteristics, propulsion, and dynamic loading environment during the attack. In addition, a discussion of possible loss scenarios, informed by both calculation results and inspections of vessel’s hull, is presented. Although the story of what happened to H. L.

Data-Model Fusion (DMF) is a concept developed at Martin Defense Group (legacy Navatek), in conjunction with the University of Michigan, to describe: 1. Data: information from sensors, expert knowledge, reports, inspections, surveys, or other sources regarding physical components, systems, platforms or fleets within available operating conditions 2. Model: digital representations (e.g., empirical equations, physics-based models, networks, ontological characterizations, etc) of those components, systems, platforms or fleets within simulated operating conditions. 3. Fusion: the integration of said data and models to bring both into agreement. Our data- model fusion approach uses data science techniques and machine learning methods to improve state estimates, update model parameters, identify operational areas or anomalies, and inform decision-making. Our integration approach utilizes and expands upon the state-of-the-art in data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based decision support to provide real-time actionable diagnostic and/or prognostic information on the state of real-world physical platforms. When a digital model is operationally coupled via sensors to a specific real-world component, system, platform, or fleet, we refer it as a digital twin. Use cases for twins involve managing degrading systems, improving performance, updating design approaches, and optimal planning for a fleet of similar platforms. Digital twins are not a necessary component in data-model fusion, but they are frequently used as a basis for analysis and decision-making in our real-world system applications. This report is a compilation of six separate reports, with an overall focus on defining a fundamental framework for data-model fusion in the naval domain. We start in Chapter 1 with a literature survey of approaches, gaps, and opportunities in data-model fusion. Next, we define in Chapter 2 a unified theory of digital twins, followed in Chapter 3 by a delineation of digital twin types in the naval domain. In Chapter 4 we discuss techniques for data persistence that enable storage of the geometry models, measurements, and environmental data needed by twins. In Chapter 5 we shift our focus back to data-model fusion, providing a survey of tools and techniques that can be used to inform naval systems design and operation. We develop methods for understanding and managing the implications, risks, and opportunities of digital naval engineering with respect to the design and operation of autonomous naval platforms and systems. Chapter 6 was written to serve as a primer on AI-based decision support methodologies, tools, and techniques for practicing naval research engineers and scientists. Finally, we conclude this report with a discussion on technology transfer, capability gaps, and opportunities for further research.","tags":[],"title":"A Generic Framework for Data Model Fusion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew L.

Additionally, the performance benefits of providing these predictive models with computationally efficient, physics-based model predictions (PBMPs) of heave, pitch, and roll as additional inputs were examined. Data from approximately 13,500 30-minute windows, measured aboard an operational research vessel, were used to train and test the data-driven models. Data from over 2,500 additional 30-minute windows, measured aboard a sister vessel, were also used to test the versatility of the trained models. The results of this study showed effective reduction of motion amplitude mean-squared error (MSE) values on multiple test datasets relative to the PBMPs alone. The results also showed that inclusion of PBMPs as input to the data-driven models was typically beneficial in terms of MSE reduction, stressing the importance of retaining physics-based information in data-driven models.","tags":["Data-driven models","Digital twin","Machine learning","Motion forecasting","Neural networks","Physics-based models"],"title":"Data-driven models for vessel motion prediction and the benefits of physics-based information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samuel J.

Estimating extreme responses of said structures often reduces to purely probabilistic approaches involve a considerable amount of conjecture. A method is developed in this paper to conserve original system information without the need for high fidelity Monte Carlo Simulations. Here, an iterative linearization of a non-linear system is developed to estimate extremes for the non-linear system. The Matched Upcrossing Equivalent Linear System (MUELS) method finds linear systems with zero-upcrossing periods equivalent to that of the non-linear system under a specified forcing spectrum. These linear systems are used as input into the Design Loads Generator, where ensembles of extreme linear realizations at the exposure period of interest, and the input time series that lead to those extremes, are generated. These input time series are valid inputs into the non-linear system and create a set of non-linear realizations that approximate the set of non-linear extremes at the exposure period of interest. As an example, this paper introduces and applies this method to the Duffing Oscillator at various levels of increasing cubic stiffness, forced by an ITTC wave spectrum, for exposure periods as long as 10textasciicircum 8 hours representing O(10textasciicircum10) zero-crossing maxima.

However, the information about variable relationships in Bayesian network are encoded in difficult to interpret conditional probability tables (CPTs).

In this paper, the linearization of a non-linear process, namely impact loading, was completed by performing a gaussianization of a sample non-linear, non-gaussian time series to predict the probability of human injury in a specified sea state. The gaussianized time series was then input into the Design Loads Generator (DLG) to estimate a lower bound to the non-gaussian extrema as well as providing an ensemble of extreme time series of the gaussianized process. The DLG takes an input spectrum, transfer function, and associated exposure time to optimize phase sets of a modified gaussian distribution such that the extreme realizations with return periods equal to the exposure time of the desired process, as well as the input that leads to those realizations, can be generated. In the present application, the input to the corresponding gaussian extreme time series was used as input in the non-linear, non-gaussian model to estimate the extremes of the non-linear process, conditioned on the gaussian process being extreme. The process of gaussianizing the non-linear time series, entering into the DLG, and using the resulting input time series as input into the non-linear model was iterated to further develop the conditional extreme pdf. The relationship between these conditional, developed extrema and the observed extrema of the process was applied to determine the probability of human injury. Here, injury is assumed to be related to two possibly correlated random variables: the magnitude and duration of an extreme acceleration event.","tags":["Bow slamming","Extreme values","Non-linear dynamics"],"title":"Prediction of Human Injury Due to Impact","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthew L.

This work has three purposes:present tools a designer can use to codesign a planing craft with its ACS,use these tools to expand the design space and further explore the potential of codesign, andinvestigate the feasibility of having a planing craft with ACS designed to the codesign results found in 2) and compare it with a traditionally designed vessel.The vessel particulars that are numerically optimized are the beam, dead rise, longitudinal center of gravity (lcg), and two tuning parameters for the ACS's linear quadratic regulator. In the case study, the codesigned vessel had 4% lower drag at the design speed and Sea State (SS) 3, but on lower SS's it had drag savings of 10% and seakeeping improvements of around 40% for the investigated seakeeping metric. The case study suggests that although the codesigned vessel is technically feasible, it would require unconventional hull/deck design—a result which emphasizes the importance of considering the coupling between a planing craft and its ACS early in the concept design.In search for a better performing planing craft, a naval architect could consider using an active control system (ACS) on their designs. Although they will encounter published research confirming performance improvements when an ACS is used (Wang 1985; Savitsky 2003; Xi \u0026 Sun 2006; Kays et al. 2009; Engle et al. 2011; Hughes \u0026 Weems 2011; Rijkens et al. 2011; Shimozono \u0026 Kays 2011; Rijkens 2013), literature addressing the concept design process of a planing craft that will have an ACS is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, limited only to the previous work by the authors (Castro-Feliciano et al. 2016, 2018). The work by Castro-Feliciano et al. (2016, 2018) suggests that the benefit from codesigning (as opposed to sequentially designing the vessel geometry and later adding an ACS) can be significant and should be the design methodology followed when designing a planing craft that will have an ACS.","tags":[],"title":"Codesign case study of a planing craft with active control systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["H.

But despite many advancements in structural modeling, reliability analysis may still be too time consuming and computationally expensive to be employed for local design choices. Reliability analysis for stiffened ship panels is additionally complicated as the collapse mechanism is due to combined stochastic lateral and in-plane loading effects [1]. This paper employs the non-linear Design Loads Generator (NL-DLG) process [2] to efficiently estimate the probability of stiffened ship panel collapse while retaining the wave profiles which lead to lifetime responses. This information allows a direct comparison between panel options and highlights critical panel parameters which are strongly related to design robustness. The resulting ensemble of short NL-DLG wave profiles lead to similar statistical characteristics of the panel designs as do brute-force Monte Carlo Simulations, but reduce the required simulation time by a factor of nearly 87,000 for the same number of simulations. These directed wave profiles offer naval architects the opportunity to efficiently examine rare complex structural responses by linking high-fidelity structural and hydrodynamic models. The potential of the NL-DLG process is that relevant information about complex marine structures, even those with limit surfaces excited by combined non-Gaussian loading, can be obtained efficiently and in earlier stages of the design process via low-order surrogate models.","tags":["Combined non-Gaussian loading effects","Directed wave profiles for rare responses","Failure probability","Stiffened ship panel collapse"],"title":"Combined stochastic lateral and in-plane loading of a stiffened ship panel leading to collapse","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Samuel J.

Especially for large, complex marine structural tests with multiple cracks, efficient and inexpensive crack length measurement techniques are a major advantage. A computer vision based method for measuring the crack length on the surface of complex vessel structures is developed with the goals of reasonable accuracy with extreme ease-of-use. The method involves digital image acquisition with automated crack detection and then dimension measurement. In order to capture a clear image by a GoPro camera with a 12.5X macro lens, UV dyes are applied to increase contrast between cracks and structures surfaces. The images are transferred to grey scale and the crack is detected by an edge filter. Noise points are filtered out and the crack is simulated and measured on pixel level. A MATLAB code is created for the proposed method to automate the processing of images. To evaluate the method, a laboratory experiment is conducted on a hexagon tension specimen with four cracks.

The system is designed to measure ship motions and hull strain responses during high-speed operations and in harsh weather conditions. An analytical framework is developed to extract sea states from inertial measurements recorded at the ship centre-of-gravity and in a bow compartment. To assess the fatigue life of the hull during harsh weather operations, response amplitude operators (RAOs) are empirically derived to map sea states to root mean square accelerations and strain cycles measured from a high-stress hull element. A RAO that maps sea state to consumed fatigue in the hull, so termed a consumed fatigue operator (CFO), is presented which can assist in the management of an asset over its life cycle. The study reveals reliable hull monitoring during a one-week sea trial.

Many techniques have been proposed to make better decisions given this uncertainty, including robust optimisation approaches and reliability-based design optimisation. Drawing inspiration from set-based design, this work presents a different approach. Instead of making a final decision with a margin for uncertainty, the procedure allows for a gradual reduction of the design space in a manner that maximises the designer’s remaining flexibility. Two measures are first defined—the complexity of the remaining design space, and the regret, or potential loss of performance resulting from deciding at that time. The procedure solves for the Pareto front in the trade space between complexity and regret. To generate the Pareto front, the method uses two optimisers with one nested inside of the other; both the inner and outer optimisation problems are solved using a genetic algorithm. The outer optimiser is multi-objective with the complexity, or size, of the reduced design space and the resulting regret as the two objective functions. This method was used to solve a structural design problem, and the results are presented here.","tags":[],"title":"An optimization framework for design space reduction in early-stage design under uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Claire Wincott","Matthew D.

Bayesian networks can model the potential for distortion as a result of specific design parameters and process operations. Bayesian networks capture a complex web of cause-effect relationships, such as the mechanics of a structural panel’s production, and break them down into a series of smaller conditional relationships that are more easily established. By breaking down a panel line and creating a series of connected networks modeling each step, the potential for distortion can be predicted from design parameters such as plate thickness and cutout locations and manufacturing decisions such as the use of automated seam welding. The series of networks allows the distortion measured upstream to update the probabilities of downstream nodes. Determining the effect of panel parameters on the distortion generated along a panel line allows informed detail design decisions that could reduce costly distortion in the shipyard.

Fundamental exploration of algorithms and approaches to link, compare, and fuse numerical models used in digital twins with real-world sensor data is still needed for ship performance prediction, condition assessment, and ultimately, significant implementation of digital twin technology in the marine industry. In this work, a preliminary digital twin framework for surface ships has been developed to yield time-and-place specific predictions of vessel motions and structural responses given weather forecast or hindcast data for a selected route. Cumulative fatigue damage was predicted and compared for four simulated routes in the Pacific Ocean, and the predicted motions for the simulation with the greatest fatigue damage were analyzed to investigate the possible causes of this increased damage. The notable increase in cumulative damage seen for this route stresses the importance of the ability to track and balance fatigue damage among ships in a fleet. Moreover, this information would further support educated maintenance and deployment scheduling decisions to ensure fatigue damage equality among ships in a fleet, while real-time implementation of this digital twin technology would furnish operators with a greater understanding of a weather forecast's implications, and thereby provide in-mission decision support.","tags":[],"title":"Ship motion and fatigue damage estimation via a digital twin","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark Groden","Kaihua Zhang","Matthew D.

Through Bayesian inference, the network updates underlying loading and fatigue capacity models. These updated models are then used to forecast future failures. The proposed model is tested against Monte Carlo simulated service history data on five vessels from a larger fleet.

Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) are a powerful and flexible tool to model dynamic system behavior and update reliability and uncertainty analysis with life cycle data for problems such as fatigue cracking. However, a central challenge in using DBNs is the need to discretize certain types of continuous random variables to perform network inference while still accurately tracking low-probability failure events. Most existing discretization methods focus on getting the overall shape of the distribution correct, with less emphasis on the tail region. Therefore, a novel scheme is presented specifically to estimate the likelihood of low-probability failure events. The scheme is an iterative algorithm which dynamically partitions the discretization intervals at each iteration.

These increasing costs make it desirable to design new naval structures with their minimization in mind, as well as ensuring that such vessels are robust to changes in expected service life with respect to their total lifetime cost. However, such structures will necessarily have higher production costs, therefore, an optimization framework is presented to estimate both production and maintenance costs for a naval vessel's internal structure and develop trade-spaces between these two competing objectives in order to find designs that represent a balance of both.","tags":["Lifetime cost","Maintenance","Naval design","Production","Structural optimization"],"title":"Minimizing lifetime structural costs: Optimizing for production and maintenance under service life uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David P.

In doing so, first-order load interactions are presumed to arise from the random occurrence and severity of physical storms encountered by ships and offshore structures throughout their service lives. This material hysteresis is captured through a time-dependent crack “opening” level ( K op ) which is based on the evolution of a rate-independent, incremental plasticity model simulating combined nonlinear kinematic and isotropic hardening. The result is a mechanistic rather than phenomenological numerical model requiring only experimentally measured fatigue crack growth rates under constant amplitude, cyclic loading (e.g., ASTM E647-13) and a full material constitutive model defined through experimental push–pull tests for the same material. This approach permits a consideration of material behaviors which are physically relevant to structural steels, yet necessarily omitted in the similar application of a strip-yield model.  The present paper generalizes the model originally proposed by the authors to now consider arbitrary storm model loading sequences taken from high-fidelity, time-domain seakeeping codes. To predict the fatigue fracture induced by variable amplitude stress records with upwards of 5 × 10 6 time-dependent cycles, a consistent modeling reduction is applied based on the Ordered Overall Range (OOR) or racetrack counting method. The resultant crack growth behavior is demonstrated to converge remarkably well for sufficiently small refined mesh sizes. Using this model, and by considering different arrangements of the same stress record, the importance of nonlinearities (i.e., those associated with ship response as well as material hysteresis) are emphasized.","tags":["Finite element analysis of plasticity-induced crack closure","Load interactions","Nonlinear fatigue crack growth","Ship structures","Storm model loading"],"title":"Stochastic nonlinear fatigue crack growth predictions for simple specimens subject to representative ship structural loading sequences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dylan W.

While this is a successful strategy to improve optimization efficiency, challenges arise when constructing surrogate models in higher dimensional function space, where the trade space between multiple conflicting objectives is increasingly complex. This complexity makes it difficult to ensure the accuracy of the surrogates. In this article, a new surrogate management strategy is presented to address this problem. A k-means clustering algorithm is employed to partition model data into local surrogate models. The variable fidelity optimization scheme proposed in the author's previous work is revised to incorporate this clustering algorithm for surrogate model construction. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on six standard test problems. The presented algorithm is also examined in a three-objective stiffened panel optimization design problem to show its superiority in surrogate-assisted multi-objective optimization in higher dimensional objective function space. Performance metrics show that the proposed surrogate handling strategy clearly outperforms the single surrogate strategy as the surrogate size increases.","tags":["Optimization","Clustering","evolutionary computation","Kriging","Surrogate model","Variable fidelity optimization"],"title":"Improving surrogate-assisted variable fidelity multi-objective optimization using a clustering algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiandao Zhu","Yi-Jen Wang","Matthew D.

In this paper, an algorithm called spreading multi-objective particle swarm optimizer (SMOPSO) is developed and tested for optimization problems with two objectives. The motivation for SMOPSO is to promote a high diversity of solutions found in two-objective particle swarm optimization. This is attempted through the use of a spreading function based on neighboring particle positions and an archive controller which discriminates based on particle spacing. The spreading function directs non-dominated particles away from their nearest neighbor, aiming for evenly-spaced solutions as particles “spread out”. To test if such an approach can indeed improve Pareto front diversity, a performance comparison of SMOPSO is made to two benchmark algorithms. Preliminary results suggest the proposed algorithm may improve the diversity of solutions for a limited selection of optimization problems, but at the expense of other important measures of performance which is discussed in this paper. SMOPSO’s performance degrades for more difficult optimization problems, such those with multiple fronts and narrow global minima. An example application of SMOPSO to a theoretical, two-objective high-speed planing craft design problem is also given.","tags":["Optimization","Agriculture","Engineering Design","Engineering","general","Environmental Management","Multi-objective optimization","Operations Research/Decision Theory","Pareto front diversity","Pareto optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Planing craft design","Systems Theory","Control"],"title":"Testing of a spreading mechanism to promote diversity in multi-objective particle swarm optimization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joshua T.

The optimization uses a probabilistic mission profile, propeller–hull interaction, and engine information to determine the coupled system with minimum fuel cost over its operational life.

This metric is comprised of seven separate producibility drivers that are dependent on the properties of the panel. The new producibility metric is compared with a traditional costing method in a two-objective genetic algorithm to show that there is a competition between the two methods, meaning that the new metric gives a designer additional information at the early design stage. The estimated costs versus producibility scores for several grillage sizes show that large gains in producibility can be made without large increases in estimated costs up until a critical point where a knee in the Pareto front occurs. Furthermore, it was found that the individual producibility elements are highly dependent on the size of the panel tested and the constraints the panel must meet. In general, producibility is a key factor to be considered in structural design and should be accounted for in any structural optimization.","tags":["Cost assessment","Design complexity","Early stage design","Genetic optimization","Producibility","Stiffened panel"],"title":"A method for comparing panel complexity to traditional material and production cost estimating techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David P.

It is argued that recent research has produced a number of ad hoc metrics for structural design, such as producability; however, to truly address the needs of future ship design teams it is necessary to integrate several such metrics in a systems-engineering view to evaluate how the structural system contributes to the overall capabilities and costs of a proposed vessel.
