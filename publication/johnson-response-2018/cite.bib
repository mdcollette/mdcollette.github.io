 abstract = {This paper proposes a wireless hull monitoring system that is quick to install as a short-term monitoring solution. Hull measurements have the potential to increase the accuracy of ship response predictions at a lower cost than computer simulation or towing tank models. The performance of the wireless monitoring system is validated on the all-aluminium United States Coast Guard Response Boat-Medium. The system is designed to measure ship motions and hull strain responses during high-speed operations and in harsh weather conditions. An analytical framework is developed to extract sea states from inertial measurements recorded at the ship centre-of-gravity and in a bow compartment. To assess the fatigue life of the hull during harsh weather operations, response amplitude operators (RAOs) are empirically derived to map sea states to root mean square accelerations and strain cycles measured from a high-stress hull element. A RAO that maps sea state to consumed fatigue in the hull, so termed a consumed fatigue operator (CFO), is presented which can assist in the management of an asset over its life cycle. The study reveals reliable hull monitoring during a one-week sea trial. RAO and CFO fit to hull response data are proven to provide accurate estimates.},
